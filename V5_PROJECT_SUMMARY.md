- ✅ **Uncertainty Estimation**: Monte Carlo dropout for confidence intervals
- ✅ **Performance Targets**: >0.65 correlation, >55% direction accuracy

### 3. **Complete Script Suite**
- ✅ **Training Script**: `models/versions/v5_enhanced/scripts/train_v5.py`
- ✅ **Next Day Prediction**: `models/versions/v5_enhanced/scripts/predict_next_day.py`
- ✅ **Historical Simulation**: `models/versions/v5_enhanced/scripts/historical_simulation.py`
- ✅ **Data Utilities**: `models/versions/v5_enhanced/scripts/data_utils.py`

### 4. **Comprehensive Documentation**
- ✅ **Model Documentation**: `models/versions/v5_enhanced/README.md`
- ✅ **Usage Guide**: `models/versions/v5_enhanced/USAGE.md`
- ✅ **Project Organization**: `PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md`
- ✅ **V4 Documentation**: Added for completeness

### 5. **Project Organization**
- ✅ **Clean Root Folder**: Moved model-specific scripts to appropriate directories
- ✅ **Organized Structure**: Each model version in its own complete package
- ✅ **Log Management**: Moved logs to dedicated directory
- ✅ **Archive**: Old/deprecated files moved to archive

## 🚀 Ready to Use!

### Quick Start Commands

1. **Train V5 Model**:
   ```bash
   cd models/versions/v5_enhanced/scripts
   python train_v5.py
   ```

2. **Make Next Day Prediction**:
   ```bash
   python predict_next_day.py
   ```

3. **Run Historical Backtesting**:
   ```bash
   python historical_simulation.py
   ```

## 📊 Expected V5 Performance Improvements

| Metric | V2 (Current Best) | V5 (Target) | Improvement |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Correlation | 0.576 | >0.65 | +13% |
| Direction Accuracy | 50.0% | >55% | +10% |
| Close MAE% | 3.62% | <3.0% | -17% |
| Sharpe Ratio | - | >1.5 | New metric |

## 🏗️ V5 Architecture Highlights

### Multi-Scale Attention
- Captures patterns at different time scales (1, 3, 5 day windows)
- Better understanding of short-term and medium-term trends

### Adaptive Components
- **Adaptive Dropout**: Higher dropout during volatile periods
- **Residual Connections**: Better gradient flow for deeper networks
- **Feature Engineering**: 30+ sophisticated technical indicators

### Risk-Aware Predictions
- **Confidence Scores**: Model's confidence in each prediction
- **Uncertainty Estimation**: Standard deviation of predictions
- **Volatility Adjustment**: Predictions adapted to market conditions
